# Project Title

Front-end challenge solution for Elecctro company

## Description

This project was build using React.js, a famous view layer made by Facebook. The challenge was to make a simple web TODO list(see React "Challenge Advanced.pdf" in the root directory). I designed every piece of the software myself and adapted for most screen sizes.
